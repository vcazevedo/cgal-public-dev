\cgalPkgDesc{This package provides a (1D) curve skeleton extraction algorithm for a triangulated poylgonal mesh without borders based on the mean curvature flow.
        The particularity of this skeleton is that it has the same topology
        as the input mesh. For each skeleton vertex one can obtain its location and its corresponding vertices of the input mesh.
        The code is generic and works with any model of the `HalfedgeGraph`
        concept.

 \todo code: implement the random sampling of surface using the work started by Alexandru during its gsoc to get a better approximation of poles
 \todo code: expose in polygon mesh processing the function to compute the voronoi pole of a close triangle mesh
 \todo code: expose in polygon mesh processing the function to remesh locally a triangle mesh with the angle and edge length parameters
 \todo code: find the best option and remove collapse and degeneracy tags
 \todo code: avoid using EPEC for the triangulation
